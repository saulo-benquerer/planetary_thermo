\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

The Climate Crisis generates a lot of distress around the world and even as the scientific consensus thinks that the use of fossil fuel is the culprit - it's still hard to imagine a world without the use of oil. The current understanding is that carbon dioxide (CO2) increases the Greenhouse Effect that in turn generates the Global Warming. This thesis opposes this current notion of the Climate Change and blames the air conditioning systems.
\par
The rationale behind this change of perspective will be explained in the beginning and then a new experiment to prove the hypothesis will be proposed. Finally, future work will be suggested involving a new refrigeration system.
